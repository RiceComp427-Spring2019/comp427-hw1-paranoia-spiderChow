## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Junying Zhou

_Student NetID_: jz81

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: {G20}

  > You are overseeing the security for the G20 summit, inexplicably scheduled for Houston
  > this July.

- Assumptions:

  - Some bad guys would try to disturb the summit or hurt some leaders.
  - The leaders are accompanied by their own security teams, though it might be insufficient.
  - The chaos in the other part of the city would also have a great impact.

- Assets:
  - I should keep all the participators safe, since they leave their own countries or areas, making it easier to be attacked.
  - I also should keep other places in Houston in order. If Houston is not safe, the summit is quite possibly not safe either.
  - Some information is secret internationally and some decisions cannot be made public at that time.
  - The safety of the people in Houston is also very important.

- Threats:
  - Anything could be weapons. There might be drug in the food or water and explosives in the baggage. Also someone would mingle with others into the summit, with weapons to hurt the leaders.
  - There might be some bad guys making some chaos in other palces in Houston to interrupt the summit.
  - Some guys may steal information to hurt the benefits among the countries.

- Countermeasures:
  -  Everything should be inspected carefully so that there isn't drugs, knives, explosives and so on. And Everyone should be in advance authorized the access to the summit. Thus, there should be deployed Security Check Points for the entrance into the meetings. Also we should keep a card for everyone with the approved identifier on it. It is most efficient since it could cut off the direct threaten.
  - I would deploy large anount police and agents in the critical areas all over the city to avoid the chaos. And I should also make careful inspection at the airports and train stations, etc, to keep danger out of the city. However, it would be quite expensive since the number of people using those transportation is very large. But dense polive coverage would be still helpful since even though emergence happened, it could get handled in time.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Grading}

  > You are grading homework submissions for a class of 200+ students.

- Assumptions:

  - Some students might have the same name.
  - Grade should not be announced in public.

- Assets:
  - The homework should not be modified by neither the owner nor other students.
  - Privacy is also one of the assets. The grade of the homework must be seen only by the owner his/herself.

- Threats:
  - Some student might try to update the homework after the deadline. If the operation is not recorded or the timestamp is easy to manipulate, it would be unfair for other students. And the 200+ submissions are difficult to keep safe.
  - There are some curious students who might try to see others' grade. It might be realized by getting some information without authorization.
  - Also, students might try to modified their own grade without authorization. 

- Countermeasures:
  - I should keep the submission in somewhere safe. For example, I will avoid cafe or library to grade them, since public places make the probability to lose homework higher. Thus, I might grade them in my home or office and if I leave the place I would lock the door.
  - When I hand out the homework, I would ask them to show their ID cards first and find the grade and give it back in person. ID cards could help me verify the name and photo. But considering that there are more than 200 students, it would take much time to hand out grade and their homework. If the homework is electrionic and graded online, it would be very efficient to use Canvas or something similar, since the netID could be the identifier for the access. But it would push all the security pressure on the Website. However, if we use the established Web application, it might be much safer, though would be charged some fees. 
  - Before I record the final grade, I should double check it. Keep it sake somewhere. If some students come to me for some grading error, I should check it carefully and make sure that it is not be modified. 

## Problem 3
- Scenario: Voting website

  > I am building a website for students in the campus to vote for candidates in a school contest.

- Assumptions:

  - Everyone should only vote once everyday during the period.
  - We allow that the condidates' friends or parents to vote, too.
  - Some students in the same area inside the campus might share wifi.

- Assets:
  - The rule that one person one vote should be respected.

- Threats:
  - Some students might try to vote many time, probably using different IP addresses.  

- Countermeasures:
  - We should utilize something to identify who vote at a moment. Student Id might be one solution, however, others inlcuding parent and friends are also allowed to vote. And if IP address is taken as the identifier, voting multiple times everyday by one persion cannot be avoid. Also some students might share the same wifi, so that the IP address should not be used as Id.
  - There might be some other expensive ways. For examples, using student id to sign up for the websites, and it might need a photo when sign up for parents and friends. Actually, what really would have an great impact on the fairness is that some people would use robots to vote for some candidates with a great number of times. Thus, as long as we could the user is a person rather than a robot, it would be safe. As a result, CAPTCHA might be cheap and easy and helpful as well. Or some technology similar with CAPTCHA might also make sense in this circumstance.
